A fine selection of Shortcake-powered shortcodes.

== Description ==

Shortcake Bakery adds a fine selection of shortcodes to your WordPress site. Use with [Shortcake](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-ui/) for the optimal experience.

The follow shortcodes are now available for your use within the content field:

- Image Comparison `[image-comparison left="9" right="10" position="center"]`
- Facebook `[facebook url="https://www.facebook.com/willpd/posts/1001217146572688"]`
- iFrames (requires code-level configuration of accepted domains) `[iframe src="http://www.buzzfeed.com"]`
- Infogram `[infogram url="http://infogr.am/washington_marijuana_sales"]`
- PDF's (requires PDF served from domain with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header) `[pdf url="https://assets.fusion.net/edit/pdfs/the_interview_budget_excerpts.pdf"]`
- Playbuzz `[playbuzz url="https://www.playbuzz.com/Fusion/5-mind-blowing-facts-about-cloning-from-jurassic-park-youll-never-believe-actually-exist-in-real"]`
- Rap Genius `[rap-genius]`
- Scribd `[scribd url="http://www.scribd.com/doc/269993358/Transgender-Care-Memorandum"]`
- Scripts (requires code-level configuration of accepted domains) `[script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/threejs/r69/three.min.js"]`

See the [Installation](#Installation) section for code-level configuration details. Get involved with the project and [submit your own shortcodes](https://github.com/fusioneng/shortcake-bakery) on Github.

== Installation ==

It's a plugin! Install it like any other.

Most of the shortcodes work out of the box, but you'll need to whitelist any domains you want to be eligible for script and iFrame tag use.

```php
	add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_script_domains', function(){
		return array(
			'ajax.googleapis.com',		
		);
	});
```

```php
	add_filter( 'shortcake_bakery_whitelisted_iframe_domains', function(){
		return array(
			'buzzfeed.com',		
		);
	});
```

== Screenshots ==

1. Shortcodes are accessible through the Insert Element screen, exposed in the media library.
2. Shortcodes preview in the visual editor, with a quick edit button to provide easy access to attribute fields.
3. The image comparison shortcode is powered by JuxtaposeJS, a tool built by the Northwestern University Knight Lab.
4. We've added an Infogram shortcode that accepts public Infogram URL's.
5. Scribd shortcodes let you embed documents easily in your WordPress content.
6. The script shortcode lets you embed whitelisted sources.
7. Same with the iFrame shortcode.
8. The RapGenius shortcode doesn't do anything in the admin â€“ but on the frontend, it adds annotations to your post.
9. The PDF shortcode wraps your document in a nifty viewer tool.
10. Most Facebook URL's can be embedded with ease.
11. Playbuzz quizs can be embedded, with a few options supported.
